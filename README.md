#An overview of the architecture- Every chapter was defined as a different function as well as the events that take place in them. There is one file that will host all of these functions and act as the main game file where each function will be placed sequentially and ran in order to carry out the game. Within those functions are the functions for the events which will behave in a similar manner after the dialogue for each chapter is complete. If you fail to complete a task the function of the chapter you're on will be called indicating that you must restart and complete it successfully to break the loop.
#How to start the program- run 'css225final.py', from there all of the chapters/functions should run back to back so the user can enjoy the game.
